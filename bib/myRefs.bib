   abstract = {Volume changes of a granite, a marble, and an aplite were measured during deformation in triaxiaI compression at confining pressure of as much as 8 kb. Stress-volumetric strain. behavior is qualitatively the same for these rocks and a wide variety of other rocks and concrete studied elsewhere. Volume changes are purely elastic at low stress. As the maximum stress becomes one-third to two-thirds the fracture •ress at a given pressxxre, the rocks become aliistent; that is, volume increases relative to elastic changes. The magnitude of the dilatancy, with a few exceptions, ranges from 0.2 to 2.0 times the elastic volume changes that would have occurred were the rock simply elastic. The magnitude of the dilatehey is not markedly affected by pressure, for the range of conditions studied here. For granite, the stress at which dilatancy was first detected was strongly time dependent; the higher the loading rate the higher the stress. I)ilatancy, which represents an increase in porosity, was traced in the granite to open cracks which form parallel with the direction of maximum compression.},

@article{李翻翻2020,
   abstract = {Demonstrated by a series of triaxial compression tests, the mechanical properties of claystone are related to its stress state. The relationship between them shows that the larger the confining pressure is, the higher the claystone samples' peak stress is and the later it develops. This is subject to the tendency of microcrack closure within specimens under high confining pressure, suggesting that high confining pressure has certain inhibitory effects on the development of microcracks. Therefore, the peak stress appears in higher magnitude and at a later stage. However, the degree of the stress drop during the softening process is not heavily affected by the variation of confining pressure. The reason is the microcracks within the samples under different confining pressures gradually connect to each other to generate shear planes of similar type, so that the mechanical properties of the specimens are weakened to the same extent. Based on the experimental study, the paper introduces a damage evolution equation considering varying stress states by taking microcrack as the damage element (because the development of microcracks is affected by stress states). Moreover, a new constitutive model is established based on the test results and numerically implemented in Abaqus and its subroutines. Comparisons between the simulation and experimental results demonstrate the model adequacy for effectively describing the mechanical properties of claystone. The study provides theoretical guidance for the engineering construction of underground infrastructure in claystone.},

   abstract = {With the increasing demand for mineral and energy resources, deep underground operations in mining, oil and gas industries become more frequent. This also resulted in problems associated with high temperature and pressure (HTP) that rock is exposed to in deep underground conditions. It is therefore imperative to understand and correctly model the coupled thermo-mechanical (TM) behavior of rocks for better and safer designs. For this purpose, based on the Weibull distribution and Lemaitre's strain-equivalent principle, a framework for the coupled thermo-mechanical (TM) damage model for granite is developed to simulate the deformation and failure process of rock under the high temperature and pressure (HTP) conditions. The thermal damage caused by the temperature change and the mechanical damage caused by high pressure were analyzed, and a nonlinear coupled total damage parameter is proposed in this study. The Weibull distribution parameters involved in the damage model are derived by combining the geometric conditions obtained from the conventional triaxial compression tests. In order to compare the performance of the proposed damage model, Drucker-Prager failure criterion is used as an example in the nonlinear TM damage model. For the validation of the proposed model, test results for granite samples at various temperature and confining pressures were compared in which the theoretical results are found to be in a good agreement with the experimental results. The proposed coupled TM damage model can be used in conjunction with any other failure criteria to account the damage evolution under HTP conditions.},

   abstract = {Creep tests were carried out on Inada granite under con®ning pressure and on dry and wet specimens of Kamisunagawa sandstone. Distinctive points Q A (the point where the axial strain rate reaches a minimum), Q C (the point where the magnitude of circumferential strain rate reaches a minimum) and R C (the point where the magnitude of circumferential strain acceleration begins to increase) were de®ned. Dependency of the strain values at the distinctive points on creep stress, con®ning pressure and water presence was examined. Circumferential strain at Q C or R C was not aected by creep stress for both rocks. Peak load points were observed in reloading stress±strain curves when reloading was carried out before Q C for Kamisunagawa sandstone. Circumferential strain values at peak load during reloading coincided with critical extensile strain, which is de®ned as circumferential strain value at peak load during constant strain rate tests and is insensitive to con®ning pressure, water presence, and anisotropy, although slightly aected by strain rate. Load increased slightly or did not increase when reloading was carried out after R C for both rocks. R C in creep tests scattered around unloading stress±strain curves from peak load during constant strain rate tests for Kamisunagawa sandstone. These observations suggest that Q C and R C in creep tests are closely related to the peak load points during constant strain rate tests. Circumferential strain would be used as a condition-insensitive damage indicator of rock in creep tests as well as in constant strain rate tests. #},

Since so far no regard was paid to relaxation behaviour, corresponding test results are not available and hence a special device for performing of uniaxial relaxation tests had to be constructed. Some interesting test results are discussed in the paper. These results are useful for the verification of constitu-tive equations. A critical analysis of conventional constitutive laws and their fundamentals shows that these material laws have considerable imperfections and are rested on substantial restrictions. Particularly, they are not able to describe relaxation behaviour sufficiently. Consequently, a constitutive law is proposed consisting of a strain hardening appl:oach with separate creep and relaxation functions. By post-calculation of different laboratory tests it could be shown that in comparison to conventional steady-state creep equations this material law describes the viscous behaviour of rock salt more realistically.},

@article{邓华锋2016,
   abstract = {Rheology has extremely significant influence on the long-term deformation and stability of engineering rock mass. Current experimental research on unloading rheology only considers the stress path under unloading confining pressure with the constant axial stress, however it is different from the process of stress adjustment in surrounding rock during tunnel excavating. Stepwise unloading rheological tests are conducted on sandy mudstone samples which are under unloading confining pressure with the axial compression or with the constant axial stress. The results show that the rheological deformation trends of rock samples under both unloading confining pressure are generally consistent. At the same initial confining pressure, the failure confining pressure under axial compression and the deviatoric stress are relatively higher than that under constant axial stress, but the ratio of long-term strength to failure stress is opposite. When the confining pressure unloads reach up to the point where the rock sample approaches failure, the growth rate of rheological strain under axial compression obviously becomes faster than that under constant axial stress, and the failure occurs more suddenly. The failure modes of rock samples under constant axial stress usually appear as one complete shear failure plane. By contrast, the failure modes of rock samples under axial compression are more complicated with a certain amount of secondary shear cracks and tension cracks, in addition to the controlled shear failure plane. Moreover, the secondary cracks increase with the increase of initial confining pressure. Therefore, the unloading confining pressure with the constant axial stress seems difficultly satisfy the requirement of engineering projects undergone a long-term deformation and stability of surrounding rock. The stress paths of tests should be conducted in more detail to simulate the actual stress change process of engineering rock mass. The results provide insights into the research on long-term deformation and stability of underground surrounding rock.},

   abstract = {Horizontal cavern structures are discussed as a means to constructing energy storage facilities in bedded salt formations. During their design, the spacing of injection and discharge boreholes for solution mining is an important variable determining cavern length, shape and construction cost, but also influencing the long-term mechanical behavior during the storage of oil or gas. Increasing the borehole spacing has been suggested in order to increase cavern capacity and construction rate while decreasing construction cost but its mechanical consequences have yet to be explored. In this paper, cavern geometries constructed with different borehole spacings are obtained using a solution mining simulation model. Static creep analyses have been conducted based on these geometrical models to discuss the impact of the maximum cavern length on the mechanical behavior of the caverns. The results show that the creep deformation of the horizontal cavern induces limited volume change depending on operating pressures. Increasing the length of the cavern initially increases cavern roof displacement and volumetric convergence, but plateaus after a length 600 m, i.e. 5 to 6 times the cross-sectional diameter. A similar behavior is observed in terms of selected integrity criteria. The results indicate the principal possibility to access larger storage volumes and higher construction speed by increasing the borehole spacing to longer than 5 to 6 times the designed cross-sectional diameter.},

   abstract = {The mechanical characteristics of salt rock are investigated using uniaxial compression tests and creep tests in a salt diapir located in the south of Iran. To investigate how the microstructure evolution of salt rock due to creep test affects the stress-strain behavior, the crept samples were again tested at a constant displacement rate. The test results showed that the axial peak stress, axial peak strain, and modulus of elasticity gradually increase with increasing strain rate. The stress-strain curves were typical for a ductile material characterized by moderate strain hardening. The creep strain and creep rate increased with increasing axial stress. The Burgers viscoelastic creep model agreed quite well with the experimental creep data. The microstructure observations indicated that grain-boundary cracking and grain boundary sliding were the dominant deformation mechanisms. Under the uniaxial compression test, the crept samples showed a slightly higher modulus of elasticity compared to the intact salt samples. Finally, it seems that free dislocations increased during the creep test led to strain hardening of salt samples through the uniaxial compression test.},

The creep behavior of rock salt plays a major role in the long-term stability of rock salt depositories. Temperature and deviatoric stress significantly impact the creep behavior of rock salt. This paper studies the influences of temperature and deviatoric stress on the creep behavior of natural single-crystal rock salt specimens using creep experiments. A special triaxial thermal cell was developed to conduct the experiments. Prismatic specimens were cut out of a large mass of a sample that was acquired from Windsor Salt Mine, Ontario, Canada. The prepared specimens were tested in one-dimensional creep experiments at 20, 100, and 150° C temperatures and under 1 MPa confining pressure. Constant deviatoric stresses (σd) of 4, 10, and 12 MPa were applied to the specimens. Increasing the applied deviatoric stress and temperature caused an increase in the accumulated strain during the experiments and resulted in higher steady-state strain rates. Although the transient strain rate is increased at elevated temperatures, it appears to be insensitive to the applied deviatoric stress.},

   abstract = {The lithology of fracture zone which was developed at the dam foundation of a hydropower station is weak sandstone with poor integrity and pore cementation contact. Its creep properties have a significant impact on the deformation and stability of the dam. Based on the characteristics of loose organizational structure, high moisture content and poor mechanical properties, the triaxial compression tests and creep tests were carried out, respectively. The results show significant non-linear, low strength and no obvious strength peaks. Both axial and lateral strains are achieved more than 3\% when the tests are failed. The weak sandstone has a significant creep property, but only transient and steady state appear under low stress. Increased stress causes creep intensified and lateral strain gradually exceeds axial strain. In the failure stage, it has characteristics of large axial plastic deformation, obvious volumetric ductility dilation and large steady creep rate. The accelerated creep appears shortly after transient loading under confining of pressures 1.0 MPa and 1.5 MPa. Therefore, an improved Burgers creep model considering the non-linear characteristics of weak sandstone is built based on hyperbolic equation and the creep parameters are identified. This model can well describe the creep properties of weak sandstone. © 2013 Central South University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {Underground rock dynamic disasters are becoming more severe due to the increasing depth of human operations underground. Underground temperature and pressure conditions contribute significantly to these disasters. Therefore, it is important to understand the coupled thermo-mechanical (TM) behaviour of rocks for the long-term safety and maintenance of underground tunnelling and mining. Moreover, investigation of the damage, strength and failure characteristics of rocks under triaxial stress conditions is important to avoid underground rock disasters. In this study, based on Weibull distribution and Lemaitre's strain equivalent principle, a statistical coupled TM constitutive model for sandstone was established under high temperature and pressure conditions. The triaxial test results of sandstone under different temperature and pressure conditions were used to validate the model. The proposed model was in good agreement with the experimental results up to 600 °C. The total TM damage was decreased with increasing temperature, while it was increased with increasing confining pressure. The model's parameters can be calculated using conventional laboratory test results.},
